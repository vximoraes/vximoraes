## Hello, World! üëã

I'm Vini, a Back-End and AI Developer focused on building efficient and scalable systems. My work involves creating intelligent solutions that automate workflows and deliver strategic value, with a clear focus on innovation and excellence. I am motivated by the opportunity to build high-impact solutions that solve real problems.

Outside of code, you'll find me watching movies, reading, or capturing my own thoughts through writing. I'm also a huge fan of car performance, from the engineering behind fast machines to the culture and history that surround them.
